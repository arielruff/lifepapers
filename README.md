## What are Life Papers?
Life Papers are a super simple way to keep track of things that you constantly forget the location of. Life Papers is not an application in the traditional sense. Instead of having to deal with software installation and other problems that come with software, Life Papers is a universal solution which only requires a web browser, Life Papers uses your web browser's local database to store lists of items which you create. This means that your lists are not stored on the internet and can only be accessed by the computer they were created on (for the most part).

## For the most part?
Yes. Since Life Papers stores your lists in your browser's local database, you are encouraged to backup lists as you make them as clearing your browser's save data WILL DELETE YOUR LISTS. Backing up is a really simple process. One click, saves your list to an independent text file which can later be imported later at any time.

## Is my information safe?
This simple answer is NO. Your lists are saved as a standard text file so DO NOT add information such as passwords or extremely valuable objects to a list, unless those objects are stored securely at their location (i.e. a safe). Either way, this is not the place to note the $100,000 stored in your bathroom wall.

## How do I get started?
1. Download the LifePapers.zip file from here or the official website. [www.papers.life](https://www.papers.life)
2. Extract the zip to your favorite location.
3. Open the LifePapers.html file.
5. Choose an item category.
6. Start filing in your lists.
5. Save each list as a txt file to ensure you have a backup.

## Else:
Life Papers is a project I built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JS, and the use of HTML local storage with YDN-DB. If you would like to donate, feel free to head to
